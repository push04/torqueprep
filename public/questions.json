    "question_text": "It is interesting to note that a solid suffers strain when subjected to shear forces whereas a fluid suffers Rate of Strain i.e. it flows under similar circumstances. Concept of Continuum The concept of continuum is a kind of idealization of the continuous description of matter where the properties of the matter are considered as continuous functions of space variables. Although any matter is composed of several molecules, the concept of continuum assumes a continuous distribution of mass within the matter or system with no empty space, instead of the actual conglomeration of separate molecules. Describing a fluid flow quantitatively makes it necessary to assume that flow variables ( pressure, velocity etc.) and fluid properties vary continuously from one point to another. Mathematical descriptions of flow on this basis have proved to be reliable and treatment of fluid medium as a continuum has firmly become established. For example density at a point is normally defined as Here Δ is the volume of the fluid element and m is the mass If Δ is very large ρ is affected by the inhomogeneities in the fluid medium. Considering another extreme if Δ is very small, random movement of atoms (or molecules) would change their number at different times. In the continuum approximation point density is defined at the smallest magnitude of Δ , before statistical fluctuations become significant. This is called continuum limit and is denoted by Δ c. One of the factors considered important in determining the validity of continuum model is molecular density. It is the distance between the molecules which is Page 4 of 307 Properties of Fluids S K Mondal’s Chapter 1 characterised by mean free path ( λ ). It is calculated by finding statistical average distance the molecules travel between two successive collisions. If the mean free path is very small as compared with some characteristic length in the flow domain (i.e., the molecular density is very high) then the gas can be treated as a continuous medium. If the mean free path is large in comparison to some characteristic length, the gas cannot be considered continuous and it should be analysed by the molecular theory. A dimensionless parameter known as Knudsen number, K n = λ / L, where λ is the mean free path and L is the characteristic length. It describes the degree of departure from continuum. Usually when Kn> 0.01, the concept of continuum does not hold good. Beyond this critical range of Knudsen number, the flows are known as slip flow (0.01 < Kn < 0.1), transition flow (0.1 < Kn < 10) and free-molecule flow (K n > 10). However, for the flow regimes considered in this course, K n is always less than 0.01 and it is usual to say that the fluid is a continuum. Other factor which checks the validity of continuum is the elapsed time between collisions. The time should be small enough so that the random statistical description of molecular activity holds good. In continuum approach, fluid properties such as density, viscosity, thermal conductivity, temperature, etc. can be expressed as continuous functions of space and time. Ideal and Real Fluids",

    "question_text": "Real Fluid An Real fluid is one which has viscosity surface tension and compressible Naturally available all fluids are real fluid. Viscosity Definition : Viscosity is the property of a fluid which determines its resistance to shearing stresses. Cause of Viscosity : It is due to cohesion and molecular momentum exchange between fluid layers. Newton’s Law of Viscosity : It states that the shear stress (τ) on a fluid element layer is directly proportional to the rate of shear strain. The constant of proportionality is called the co-efficient of viscosity. Page 5 of 307 Properties of Fluids S K Mondal’s Chapter 1 When two layers of fluid, at a distance ‘dy’ apart, move one over the other at different velocities, say u and u+du .

(d) When a body is either wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, a lift is generated due to the net vertical component of hydrostatic pressure forces experienced by the body. This lift is called the buoyant force and the phenomenon is called buoyancy. IES-2.Assertion (A): The buoyant force for a floating body passes through the centroid of the displaced volume. [IES-2005] Reason (R): The force of buoyancy is a vertical force & equal to the weight of fluid displaced. A of A IES-2. Ans. (a) When a solid body is either wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, the hydrostatic lift due to net vertical component of the hydrostatic pressure forces experienced by the body is called the buoyant force. The buoyant force on a submerged or floating body is equal to the weight of liquid displaced by the body and acts vertically upward through the centroid of displaced volume known as centre of buoyancy. The x coordinate of the center of the buoyancy is obtained as ∀∀∀=∫∫∫ 81x xd Which is the centroid of the displaced volume . It is due to the buoyant force is equals to the weight of liquid displaced by the submerged body of volume and the force of buoyancy is a vertical force.

Pitot-tube in Pipe flow The ‘stagnation pressure’ at a point in a fluid flow is the total pressure which would result if the fluid were brought to rest isentropically. In actual practice, a stagnation point is created by bringing the fluid to rest at the desired point and the pressure at the point corresponds to the stagnation pressure as shown is above fig. A & B, ‘h’. A simple device to measure the stagnation pr. is a tube with a hole in the front inserted in the flow such that the velocity is normal to the plane of the hole.

What is the difference between Free vortex flow and forced vortex flow? Answer: Vortex flow: A flow in which the whole fluid mass rotates about an axis. In vortex flow streamlines are curved. Forced vortex flow: Forced vortex flow is one in which the fluid mass is made to rotate by means of some external agency. Here angular velocity, rωv== constant Example: Rotation of water through the runner of a turbine. Free vortex flow: Free vortex flow is one in which the fluid mass rotates without any external impressed contact force. The whole fluid mass rotates either due to fluid pr. itself or the gravity or due to rotation previously imparted. Here Moment of Momentum = const. i.e. ×Vr= constant Example: A whirlpool in a river.

(c) i.e. an adverse pressure gradient. When the pressure goes increasing 0P x∂⎛⎞>⎜⎟∂⎝⎠ in the direction of flow, the pressure force acts against the direction of direction of flow thus retarding the flow. This has an effect of retarding th e flow in the boundary layer and hence thickenings the boundary layer more rapidly. This and the boundary shear bring the fluid in the boundary layer to rest and causes back flow. Due to this the boundary layer no more sticks to th e boundary but is shifted away from the boundary. This phenomenon is called as “Boundary Layer Separation”. Page 146 of 307 Boundary Layer Theory S K Mondal’s Chapter 8 GATE-7.

Drag on cylinders and spheres decreases when the Reynolds number is in the region of 2 × 105 since [IES-1993] IES-43. Ans. (d) In the region of 2 × 105 (Reynolds number), the boundary layer on the cylinders and sphere begins to become unstable and thus boundary layer is said to reattach and the separation point moves back along the cylinder. Due to flow reattachment, a pressure recovery takes place over the back side and thus the drag force decreases. IES-44. During the flow over a circular cylinder, the drag coefficient drops significantly at a critical Reynolds number of 2 × 105. This is due to IES-44. Ans. (d) The drag co-efficient remains practically constant unit a Reynold’s number of 2 × 105 is reached. At this stage the C d drops steeply by a factor of 5.

Assertion (A): In an ideal fluid, separation from a continuous surface would not occur with a positive pressure gradient. [IAS-2000] Reason (R): Boundary layer does not exist in ideal fluid.

Flow separation is caused by: [IAS-1996; IES-1994, 1997;2000; GATE-2002] IAS-19. Ans. (c) i.e. an adverse pressure gradient. When the pressure goes increasing 0P x∂⎛⎞>⎜⎟∂⎝⎠ in the direction of flow, the pressure force acts against the direction of direction of flow thus retarding the flow. This has an effect of retarding th e flow in the boundary layer and hence thickenings the boundary layer more rapidly. This and the boundary shear bring the fluid in the boundary layer to rest and causes back flow. Due to this the boundary layer no more sticks to th e boundary but is shifted away from the boundary.

IES-12. Ans. (b) Terminal velocity 2 1VD∞ for al1 diameters. Stokes’ formula forms the basis for determination of viscosity of oils which consists of allowing a sphere of known diameter to fail freely in the oil. After initial acceleration. The sphere attains a constant velocity known as Te rminal Velocity which is reached when the external drag on the surface and buoyancy, both acting upwards and in opposite to the motions, become equal to the downward force due to gravity. Circulation and Lift on a Circular Cylinder IES-13. The parameters for ideal fluid flow around a rotating circular cylinder can be obtained by superposition of some elementary flows. Which one of the following sets would describe the flow around a rotating circular cylinder? [IES-1997] IES-13. Ans. (a) IES-14. Assertion (A): When a circular cylinder is placed normal to the direction of flow, drag force is essentially a function of the Reynolds number of the flow. [IES-1993] Reason (R): As Reynolds Number is about 100 and above, eddies formed break away from either side in periodic fashion, forming a meandering street called the Karman Vortex street. IES-14.

Ans. (d) IES-23. Which one of the following is true of flow around a submerged body? number and Reynolds number number from drag and skin friction drag. IES-23. Ans. (d) Profile drag comprises two components. Surface friction drag and normal pressure drag (form drag). IES-24. When pressure drag over a body is large as compared to the friction drag, then the shape of the body is that of: [IES-2000] IES-24. Ans. (d) IES-25. Assertion (A): Aircraft wings are slotted to control separation of boundary layer especially at la rge angles of attack. [IES-2003] Reason (R): This helps to increase the lift and the aircraft can take off from, and land on, short runways. IES-25. Ans. (c) IES-26. The critical value of Mach number for a subsonic airfoil is associated with sharp increase in drag due to local shock formation and its interaction with the boundary layer. A typical value of this critical Mach number is of the order of: [IES-1995] IES-26. Ans. (c) The critical Mach number is defined as free stream Mach number at which Sonic flow(M = 1) is first achieved on the airfoil surface. Critical value of mach number for a subsonic airfoil is 1.1 to 1.3. Previous Years IAS Questions Expressions for Drag and Lift IAS-1. Assertion (A): A body with larg e curvature causes a larger pressure drag and, therefore, larger resistance to motion. [IAS-2002] Reason (R): Large curvature diverg es the streamlines, decreases the velocity resulting in the increase in pressure and development of adverse pressure gradient leading to reverse flow near the boundary.

(c) What is a sediment forebay: A sediment forebay is a small pool located near the inlet of a storm basin or othe r stormwater management facility. These devices are designed as initial storage ar eas to trap and settle out sediment and heavy pollutants before they reach the main basin. Installing an earth beam, gabion wall, or other barrier near the inlet to cause stormwater to pool temporarily can form the pool area. Se diment forebays act as a pretreatment feature on a stormwater pond and can greatly reduce the overall pond maintenance requirements. Why consider a sediment forebay: These small, relatively simple devices add a water quality benefit beyond what is accomplished by the basin itself.
